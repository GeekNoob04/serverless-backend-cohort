# Serverless Backend Cohort 🚀

This project is a serverless backend built using Cloudflare Workers. It provides a foundation for building scalable and efficient APIs and applications without managing traditional servers. It's designed to be easily configurable and extensible, allowing you to quickly deploy and manage your backend logic on Cloudflare's global network.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture:** Leverages Cloudflare Workers for automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing.
- **TypeScript Support:** Written in TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
- **Configurable Bindings:** Supports bindings to other Cloudflare services like KV, R2, and Durable Objects.
- **Observability:** Includes built-in observability features for monitoring and debugging.
- **Environment Variable Management:** Easily manage environment variables through the Wrangler CLI.
- **Automatic Type Generation:** Uses Wrangler to automatically generate TypeScript type definitions for the worker environment.
- **Simple HTTP Handling:** Provides a basic `fetch` handler for processing HTTP requests.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Tooling:** Wrangler CLI
- **Configuration:** `wrangler.jsonc`
- **Type Definitions:** `worker-configuration.d.ts`
- **Web APIs:** Standard web APIs (Request, Response, Headers, etc.)
- **Cloudflare APIs:** Cloudflare-specific APIs (ExecutionContext, etc.)

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=16)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/): `npm install -g wrangler`
- Cloudflare account and Workers enabled

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

1.  Log in to your Cloudflare account using Wrangler:

    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

2.  Start the local development server:

    ```bash
    wrangler dev
    ```

    This will start the worker locally, and you can access it at the provided URL.

## 💻 Usage

1.  **Configure your worker:** Modify the `wrangler.jsonc` file to configure your worker's name, entry point, and bindings.

2.  **Define environment variables:** Add environment variables to the `vars` section of `wrangler.jsonc`.

3.  **Implement your logic:** Implement your worker's logic in the `src/index.ts` file. Use the `Env` interface to access environment variables and bindings.

4.  **Deploy your worker:** Deploy your worker to Cloudflare using the Wrangler CLI:

    ```bash
    wrangler deploy
    ```
